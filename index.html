          <p>With advancements in cellular agriculture and synthetic biology, our ORIGIN chicken sandwich is made with high quality chicken cells, giving you the same great taste you know and love from Popeyes!</p>
          <p>But it doesn't stop there! Each sandwich comes with additional ORIGIN cells that you can use to grow your own cultured meat.</p>
          <p>Simply add water to the nutrient-rich packaging, seal the cells inside for a few days, and that's it — your own ORIGIN sandwich, grown by you! Because we believe that something this good deserves seconds.</p>

          <h1>A return to the beginning.</h1>
          <p>We recognize the adverse effects traditional meat cultivation practices have on our planet. At Popeyes, we wanted to go all the way back to the origin of life & take a look at its basic building blocks to understand how we can build a more sustainable future.</p>
          <p>We infused this understanding into the ORIGIN sandwich, grown entirely from the highest quality chicken STEM cells. The results are ethically-sourced & nutrient-packed chicken — without compromising on taste.</p>

          <h1>Sustainability.</h1>
          <p>The simplest and most effective way to reduce your carbon footprint is by being conscious about the food you buy and eat. According to a study done by the FAO,global livestock accounts for roughly 14.5% of human-led GHG emissions.</p>
          <p>The ORIGIN burger allows us to reduce our land andwater use, while also lowering the harmful greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.</p>
          <p>By choosing Popeyes' ORIGIN burger, you're not only making the ethical choice; you're also doing your part to fight for climate justice.</p>
